# Exercise 3.2 - Complete Solution and Explanation

## What Exercise 3.2 Requires

Exercise 3.2 asks you to:

1. **Try at least 3 different prompt techniques** (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role prompting, etc.)
2. **Compare the results** between techniques and models
3. **Document**:
   - Exact prompt text
   - Model's raw output
   - Reflection on effectiveness (factual accuracy, consistency, clarity, creativity)

## Solution Overview

I've implemented **5 prompting techniques** (exceeding the minimum requirement):

1. ‚úÖ **Zero-Shot Prompting** - Direct instruction
2. ‚úÖ **Few-Shot Prompting** - Learning from examples
3. ‚úÖ **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** - Step-by-step reasoning
4. ‚úÖ **Role-Based Prompting** - Persona assignment
5. ‚úÖ **Structured Output** - Format specification

Each technique is tested on **both models** (FLAN-T5 and TinyLlama) for comprehensive comparison.

## The 5 Prompting Techniques Explained

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Zero-Shot Prompting

**Definition**: Give the model a task with no examples or additional context.

**Example Prompt**:

```
Summarize this scientific abstract in 2-3 sentences:

[ABSTRACT TEXT]
```

**When to use**:

- Quick, straightforward tasks
- When the task is common (e.g., "summarize", "translate")
- Model has likely seen similar tasks during training

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ Fast - no need to craft examples
- ‚úÖ Simple - minimal prompt engineering
- ‚úÖ Works well for instruction-tuned models

**Cons**:

- ‚ùå Less control over style/format
- ‚ùå May not match specific requirements
- ‚ùå Quality varies by model capability

**Expected Results**:

- **FLAN-T5**: Should work well (designed for this)
- **TinyLlama**: May need more guidance

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Few-Shot Prompting

**Definition**: Provide 1-3 examples of the task before asking the model to perform it.

**Example Prompt**:

```
Summarize scientific abstracts concisely.

Example 1:
Abstract: "Black holes are regions of spacetime..."
Summary: "Observations confirmed black hole predictions..."

Example 2:
Abstract: "Climate models predict..."
Summary: "Models predict 1.5-2¬∞C warming..."

Now summarize this abstract:
[ABSTRACT TEXT]
Summary:
```

**When to use**:

- Need specific style or format
- Task is ambiguous or specialized
- Want consistency across many outputs

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ Better control over output style
- ‚úÖ Models learn the pattern quickly
- ‚úÖ Improves consistency dramatically

**Cons**:

- ‚ùå Requires good examples (garbage in, garbage out)
- ‚ùå Longer prompts (more tokens)
- ‚ùå Time to create quality examples

**Expected Results**:

- **FLAN-T5**: Follows example style well
- **TinyLlama**: Benefits significantly from examples

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Definition**: Ask the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving the final answer.

**Example Prompt**:

```
Read this scientific abstract and summarize it step-by-step:

[ABSTRACT TEXT]

Let's approach this systematically:
1. First, identify the main subject and what was studied.
2. Second, identify the key findings or observations.
3. Third, explain the significance or implications.
4. Finally, write a concise 2-sentence summary combining these points.

Step-by-step analysis and summary:
```

**When to use**:

- Complex tasks requiring reasoning
- Need interpretability (see model's "thinking")
- Multi-step problems

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ More thoughtful, accurate outputs
- ‚úÖ Shows reasoning process
- ‚úÖ Helps debug model errors

**Cons**:

- ‚ùå Much longer outputs
- ‚ùå Slower generation
- ‚ùå May over-explain simple tasks

**Expected Results**:

- **FLAN-T5**: Can follow steps but mechanical
- **TinyLlama**: Excels at natural reasoning (decoder-only strength)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Role-Based Prompting

**Definition**: Assign the model a specific role or persona (e.g., "You are a science journalist").

**Example Prompt**:

```
You are a science journalist writing for a general audience magazine.
Your job is to make complex research accessible and engaging to non-experts.

Scientific Abstract:
[ABSTRACT TEXT]

Write a brief 2-3 sentence summary that a high school student could
understand, while keeping the key scientific findings. Make it engaging
but accurate:
```

**When to use**:

- Need specific tone or style
- Audience-specific content
- Domain expertise simulation

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ Dramatic style shifts possible
- ‚úÖ Audience adaptation
- ‚úÖ More engaging outputs

**Cons**:

- ‚ùå May sacrifice accuracy for style
- ‚ùå Risk of hallucinations
- ‚ùå Less effective on some models

**Expected Results**:

- **FLAN-T5**: Minimal style shift (not optimized for this)
- **TinyLlama**: Excellent role adoption (chat-tuned advantage)

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Structured Output Prompting

**Definition**: Request output in a specific format (bullet points, JSON, tables, etc.).

**Example Prompt**:

```
Analyze this scientific abstract and provide a structured summary:

[ABSTRACT TEXT]

Format your response as follows:
- Subject: [What was studied]
- Method: [How it was studied]
- Key Findings: [Main discoveries]
- Significance: [Why it matters]

Structured Summary:
```

**When to use**:

- Downstream processing needs structured data
- Reports, presentations, UI display
- Organizing complex information

**Pros**:

- ‚úÖ Parseable output
- ‚úÖ Consistent format
- ‚úÖ Easy to extract information

**Cons**:

- ‚ùå Can be rigid
- ‚ùå May sacrifice natural flow
- ‚ùå Format breaking possible

**Expected Results**:

- **FLAN-T5**: Excellent format adherence (encoder-decoder advantage)
- **TinyLlama**: Good, but may occasionally break format

- Note which techniques worked best
- Identify patterns and trade-offs

### Step 5: Document Your Findings

Write your own reflections addressing:

- Which technique was most effective overall?
- How did the two models differ?
- What trade-offs did you observe?
- Which would you use for production?

- **Cells 95-103** (Each technique): ~5-10 seconds per technique
- **Total**: ~2-3 minutes for all experiments

---

## Troubleshooting

### If models are slow:

- Reduce `max_tokens` parameter
- Lower `temperature` to 0.5
- Close other applications

### If you get memory errors:

- Restart the kernel
- Run one technique at a time
- Use smaller model (e.g., distilgpt2)

### If outputs seem random:

- Set `temperature=0.3` for more deterministic outputs
- Add `seed=42` to generation parameters
