CORPUS-BASED OBSERVATIONS:
- Real-world vowel duplication patterns show clear frequency distributions
- Most duplications are 'ooo', 'oooo', and 'eee' patterns
- Different approaches show significant variation in aggressiveness
- File coverage varies dramatically between approaches
- Character reduction differs substantially across methods

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Extreme approaches (reduce2plus) affect too much legitimate text
- Conservative approaches may miss many normalization opportunities
- Context-aware approaches balance quality and coverage
- Performance scales linearly with corpus size and approach complexity

RECOMMENDED APPROACH BASED ON CORPUS ANALYSIS:
Choose approach based on your specific needs:
â€¢ For maximum normalization: aggressive or reduce2plus
â€¢ For balanced results: conservative
â€¢ For quality preservation: smart normalization
â€¢ For minimal risk: extreme_only
